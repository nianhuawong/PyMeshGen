   - CAE Mesh file export
2. Study platform of widely used algorithms: 
   - curve meshing method (TODO)
   - advancing front method
   - boundary layer advancing technique
   - quadtree background mesh sizing
   - mesh optimization algorithms
3. Study platform for AI-driven Mesh Generation
   - Mesh Sampling and Dataset Construction

   - Mesh Optimization with Adam Optimizer(Adam-Smoothing)
  
This guide will walk you through the installation, usage, and advanced features of PyMeshGen.

## Chapter 2: Getting Started
To get started with PyMeshGen, you need:
1. Download/clone the source code from the following repository:
     - https://github.com/nianhuawong/PyMeshGen
2. Install requirements
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the main script 
```bash
# Generate sample mesh
python PyMeshGen.py --case "./config/30p30n.json"
```
4. The generated mesh will be saved in the `./out` directory.
   
`Note`: The configuration file `./config/30p30n.json` is used to specify the mesh generation parameters. You can modify this file to change the mesh generation parameters.

`./config/30p30n.json` is a JSON file that specifies the mesh generation parameters. The following is an example of a configuration file:
```json
{
    "debug_level": 0,  // 0: no debug, 1: debug(print), 2: verbose debug(verbose print and plot)
    "input_file": "./config/input/30p30n-small.cas", // input file path, only support .cas file format for now.
    "output_file": "./out/30p30n-hybrid.vtk", // output file path, only support.vtk file format for now.
    "viz_enabled": true, // whether to visualize the mesh when finish.
    "parts": [   // parts to generate mesh and part parameters.
        {
            "part_name": "farfield", // part name, used to identify the part.
            "max_size": 2.0, // max size of the part.
            "PRISM_SWITCH": "off", // prism switch, "off" for no prism, "wall" for wall prism.
            "first_height": 0.1, // first height of the prism layer.
            "max_layers": 5, // max layers of the prism layer.
            "full_layers": 5, // full layers of the prism layer.
            "multi_direction": false // whether to generate multi-direction at convex corner, not supported yet.
        },
        {
            "part_name": "wall",
            "max_size": 2.0,
            "PRISM_SWITCH": "wall",
            "first_height": 1e-5,
            "max_layers": 60,
            "full_layers": 5,
            "multi_direction": false
        }
    ]
}
```
`note`: To use the above JSON script, you need to remove the `//` comments in the script.

For developers, you may use VS Code and the python extensions to debug the code.

points = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]]
mesh = pmg.MeshGenerator.delaunay_triangulation(points)
```
```python
# Example 2: Refine a mesh
mesh = pmg.MeshRefiner.refine(mesh)
```
```python
# Example 3: Optimize a mesh
mesh = pmg.MeshOptimizer.optimize(mesh)
```
```python
# Example 4: Simplify a mesh
mesh = pmg.MeshSimplifier.simplify(mesh)
```
